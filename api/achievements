As humanity enters a new era of technological advancement and social harmony, questions arise about the true intentions of the alien Overlords. It becomes clear later in the story that the Overlords have plans for humanity's evolution beyond their current physical form, leading to a transcendental climax that challenges the very nature of human existence.

The original meaning of the idiom metaphorically refers to the uncertainty about which party will ultimately gain political power and can also be used in a broader sense to describe the uncertainty about who will emerge victorious in a competition. The following is the text it's derived from,\n\n\"朕若逢高皇；当北面而事之；与韩、彭竞鞭而争先耳；朕遇光武；当并驱于中原；未知鹿死谁手。\"\n\nand it's rough translation, \"If I meet Emperor Gao, I should attack from the North. I will compete with Han and Peng for leadership. If I meet Guangwu, I shall stride with him in the Central Plains. It remains uncertain whose hands the deer will fall into.\" This is taken as a literal and metaphorical sense in the context of the chive, with the Trailblazers emerging victorious while also responsible for the Ebon Deer's death.","difficulty":"easy","gacha":false,"timegated":null,"missable":false,"impossible":false,"percent":0.9965604687090098},{"id":4032501,"series":3,"series_name":"The Rail Unto the Stars","name":"Svah Sanishyu","description":"If they come back to life, then just kill them again...\\n※ Defeat the Master of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus","currency":10,"hidden":false,"version":"1.2","comment":"Defeat the Master of the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus","reference":"\"Svah Sanishyu\" is a Sanskrit term. \"Svah\" can refer to heaven or the realm of gods, and is also chanted during offerings in Hindu rituals. \"Sanishyu\" means \"wishing to gain.\" In Western game localizations, it's used as \"Svah Sanishyu,\" while in other languages, it translates to \"Short dream, [of] long life\".","difficulty":"easy","gacha":false,"timegated":null,"missable":false,"impossible":false,"percent":0.9964147258576966},{"id":4032502,"series":3,"series_name":"The Rail Unto the Stars","name":"The Imbibitor Lunae Arrives","description":"Sea's Depths Conceal No Stone, Dragon's Breaths Reveal the Moon.\\n※ Witness Dan Heng part the waters in Scalegorge Waterscape","currency":10,"hidden":false,"version":"1.2","comment":"Witness Dan Heng part the waters in Scalegorge Waterscape","reference":"The description is a quote from the poem 赠僧行融 of the Tang dynasty poet Li Bai:\n海若不隐珠，The sea doesn’t hide the pearl,\n骊龙吐明月。The dragon spit out the moon.\nIt’s… uhm, classic poetry.

The ratio between the aforementioned quantities gives the Hubble rate, in accordance to the Hubble's law. The object's distance can be inferred from the observed apparent brightness (dependent on the object's distance, intrinsic luminosity or the measure of the total amount of light emitted by the object, and any extinction of said light caused by interstellar dust along the line of sight to an observer). Meanwhile, the recession velocity is measured through the redshift, the increase in the wavelength, and corresponding decrease in the frequency and photon energy, of light. Hubble used this aproach for his original measurement of the expansion rate, which is around 70 km/s/Mpc (1 Megaparsec/Mpc = 3 x 10^6 light-years or 3 x 10^19 km).

Funny thing is, rolling 6 different Dice Faces in succession is best shown using a multinomial distribution rather than a normal distribution. Multinomial distribution involves a process that has a set of K possible results with associated probabilities and the sum of those probability must equal 1. This is because one of the results is sure to occur. So, since one side has an associated probability of 1/6, the sum of all six sides is equal to 1.

This drastic measure involves the complete and utter destruction of a planet's biosphere, effectively wiping out all life forms and making the planet uninhabitable. The decision to carry out Exterminatus is not taken lightly, as it signifies the loss of a world to the Imperium of Man, but it is considered a necessary evil to prevent the spread of heresy, alien influence, or the corruption of Chaos.","difficulty":"hard","video":"https://youtu.be/eWL3iGrW-Y0","gacha":false,"timegated":null,"missable":false,"impossible":false,"percent":0.1711312560118926},{"id":4093601,"series":9,"series_name":"Universe in a Nutshell","name":"No Ill Will","description":"Follow Herta to uncover the truth behind the \"Scepter\" system\\n※ Witness the birth of the solitary waves theory","currency":5,"hidden":false,"version":"2.6","difficulty":"easy","gacha":false,"timegated":null,"missable":false,"impossible":false,"percent":0.6594864021919725},{"id":4093602,"series":9,"series_name":"Universe in a Nutshell","name":"Butterfly on the Ripple","description":"Assist the geniuses in eliminating the Unknowable Domain within the Simulated Universe\\n※ Break through Polka Kakamond's Knowable Domain","currency":5,"hidden":false,"version":"2.6","reference":"A reference to the butterfly effect, a phenomenon in the chaos theory that describes how a tiny change in the initial stages of a system can cause huge consequences elsewhere over time.","difficulty":"easy","gacha":false,"timegated":null,"missable":false,"impossible":false,"percent":0.6508584253942344},{"id":4093603,"series":9,"series_name":"Universe in a Nutshell","name":"Last Essays","description":"Obtain the \"singular solution\" regarding the future of the universe","currency":5,"hidden":true,"version":"2.6","difficulty":"easy","gacha":false,"timegated":null,"missable":false,"impossible":false,"percent":0.6499548197160929},{"id":4093604,"series":9,"series_name":"Universe in a Nutshell","name":"The Aeons THEMSELVES","description":"Listen to a conversation that never existed","currency":5,"hidden":true,"version":"2.6","reference":"A reference to the 1972 science fiction novel, The Gods Themselves, written by Isaac Asimov.
